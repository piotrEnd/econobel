**Information architecture:**

If you've ever wondered about Nobel Prize Award Winners in economics, you now have the opportunity to retrieve them by year. It couldn't be easier. Simply choose the year, and you'll instantly access a link to their biography.

**Design:**

Initial forays into the realm of React. The app loads data from an internal JSON due to the inadequacy of the CORS configuration in the [Nobel prize API](https://nobelprize.readme.io/). Scrolling is limited intentionally to guide users to use options from a drop-down list. The subtle golden undertone exudes an elegant vibe, conveying a sense of sophistication.
